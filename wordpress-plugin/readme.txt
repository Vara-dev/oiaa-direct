Embeds the OIAA Direct online meetings application for browsing and searching recovery meetings.

== Description ==

OIAA Direct Meetings is a WordPress plugin that embeds a full-featured React application for browsing, filtering, and searching online Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The application connects to a central query API to fetch meeting data and provides an intuitive interface for finding meetings.

**Features:**

* Search meetings by name, description, or group
* Filter by type, format, features, communities, and languages
* Time-based filtering (day of week, time of day)
* Dark mode support
* Fully responsive design
* Browser-router friendly URL routing
* No external dependencies (React bundled within)

**Usage:**

Set a Base Path in Settings → OIAA Meetings (for example `/meetings`) and ensure a matching page exists. The plugin renders the app for that path and its sub-routes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/oiaa-meetings/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to Settings → OIAA Meetings to configure the API URL and Base Path.
4. Ensure a page exists that matches your Base Path (for example page slug `meetings` for `/meetings`).
5. Visit Settings → Permalinks and click "Save Changes" if you changed Base Path.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the meetings application to my site? =

Set the Base Path in Settings → OIAA Meetings and make sure a matching page exists.

= Can I customize the API endpoint? =

Yes. Go to Settings → OIAA Meetings and enter your custom API URL.

= Can I render the app on multiple pages? =

Use one Base Path per plugin instance. The app is intended to render for that configured path and its sub-routes.

= What browsers are supported? =

Modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. IE11 is not supported.

= Does this work with page builders? =

Yes, as long as the page permalink structure and configured Base Path resolve normally in WordPress.
